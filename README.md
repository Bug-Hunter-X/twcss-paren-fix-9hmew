# Tailwind CSS Unmatched Parentheses Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unmatched parentheses in class names.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of code that produces this error, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected code.

## Description

The bug arises from incorrect or incomplete class names. A missing closing parenthesis or extra opening parenthesis will cause the Tailwind CSS parser to fail and throw an error during compilation or runtime, which can manifest as unexpected styling or no styles applied at all.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and observe the incorrect Tailwind CSS class usage.
3. Attempt to render the HTML; you'll encounter the error.
4. View the corrected code in `bugSolution.js`.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the syntax of your Tailwind CSS classes. Always double-check for correctly paired parentheses, brackets, and other punctuation, ensuring each class name is correctly formatted.
